## Tasks

### Task 1: Creating HTML Structure

- Create an `index.html` file.
- Set up the basic HTML structure including `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- Add necessary meta tags (e.g., charset, viewport).
- Create the main containers and sections required for your project.

### Task 2: Adding CSS Styles

- Create a `styles.css` file in a separate directory (e.g., `css/`).
- Link the `styles.css` file to your `index.html`.
- Apply a consistent styling to the overall layout using CSS (e.g., fonts, colors, margins, padding).
- Implement responsive design principles using media queries for different screen sizes.

### Task 3: Integrating JavaScript Functionalities

- Create a `script.js` file in a separate directory (e.g., `js/`).
- Link the `script.js` file to your `index.html` just before the closing `</body>` tag.
- Define functions to handle various interactive features (e.g., buttons, forms, animations).
- Utilize JavaScript to fetch and manipulate data from APIs if applicable.

## Usage

To view your project locally in a web browser, follow these steps:

Open your project folder.
Double-click the index.html file.
This should open the HTML page in your default web browser, and you'll see the result of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code
